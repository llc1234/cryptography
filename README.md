# cryptography


The provided code defines a class named cryptography that includes methods for encryption and decryption. Let's break down what the code is doing:

Class cryptography:
The class has an __init__ method to initialize the object with an empty list called key.
encrypt method takes a string as input and encodes it using a specific algorithm.
decrypt method takes an encoded string and decodes it using the same algorithm to retrieve the original message.
Encryption Algorithm:
The encrypt method first encodes the input string into its hexadecimal representation using encode().hex().
It then converts pairs of hexadecimal characters back to integers and adds a specific value from the self.key list to each integer in a circular manner (the key list values are added sequentially in a loop).
The modified integers are converted back to characters and concatenated to form the encrypted string.
The final encrypted string is then returned after encoding it to hexadecimal format using encode().hex().
Decryption Algorithm:
The decrypt method takes the encoded string as input.
It reverses the steps of the encryption process by converting pairs of characters in the encoded string back to integers.
It then subtracts the specific values from the self.key list from each integer in a circular manner, similar to the encryption process.
The modified integers are converted back to characters and concatenated to form the decrypted string, which is returned.
Execution:
An instance of the cryptography class is created, and a key list is assigned to it.
The encrypt method is used to encrypt the string "Secret Message", and the result is stored in the encrypt variable.
The decrypt method is then used to decrypt the encrypt variable, and the result is stored in the decrypt variable.
Finally, both the encrypted and decrypted messages are printed.
It's important to note that the encryption and decryption processes are based on the values stored in the self.key list. Changing this key will affect the encryption and decryption processes. Additionally, the code might not be suitable for strong security purposes, as the encryption algorithm appears to be relatively simple and could be easily reversed if the key and algorithm are known.
